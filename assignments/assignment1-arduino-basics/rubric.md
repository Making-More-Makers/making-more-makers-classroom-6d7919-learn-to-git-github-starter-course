## Circuit Construction (3 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **3** | Circuit correctly built with all components properly connected. Clear photos or professional circuit diagram provided. Wiring is neat and organized. |
| **2** | Circuit works correctly but wiring could be neater or documentation could be clearer. Minor connection issues that don't affect functionality. |
| **1** | Circuit partially working or poorly documented. Significant wiring issues or unclear photos/diagrams. |
| **0** | Circuit non-functional, not documented, or not submitted. |

---

## Code Quality (4 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **4** | Clean, well-organized code. Comprehensive comments explaining logic. Follows Arduino best practices. Good variable names. No unnecessary code. |
| **3** | Working code with adequate comments. Generally well-organized but could be improved. Some unclear variable names or minor issues. |
| **2** | Code works but poorly organized or minimally commented. Difficult to understand logic. Poor naming conventions. |
| **1** | Code barely works or has significant issues. Very few or no comments. Difficult to read. |
| **0** | Code doesn't compile, doesn't work, or not submitted. |

**Best Practices Checklist**:
- [ ] Meaningful variable names
- [ ] Constants defined for pin numbers
- [ ] Comments explain "why" not just "what"
- [ ] No magic numbers
- [ ] Proper indentation
- [ ] Logical structure

---

## Functionality (2 points)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **2** | All required features implemented and working perfectly. Input meaningfully controls output. Creative interaction. |
| **1** | Basic functionality works but limited interaction or minor bugs. Meets minimum requirements only. |
| **0** | Doesn't work, missing required features, or not submitted. |

**Requirements**:
- ✅ At least 1 input device
- ✅ At least 1 output device
- ✅ Meaningful interaction between them

---

## Documentation (1 point)

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Complete README with all sections filled. Clear description, component list, circuit diagram/photo, usage instructions, and reflection. Photos of physical build included. |
| **0.5** | README present but missing key sections or unclear. Photos missing or poor quality. |
| **0** | No documentation or extremely minimal. |

**README Checklist**:
- [ ] Project title and description
- [ ] Components list
- [ ] Circuit diagram or clear photo
- [ ] How to use instructions
- [ ] Code explanation
- [ ] Challenges faced
- [ ] Photos of physical circuit
