## 🚨 Common Challenges & Solutions | 常见挑战与解决方案

### Challenge 1: Time Management | 时间管理

**Problem**: Different students work at very different paces

**Solutions**:
- Have "extension challenges" for fast finishers
- Allow slower students to simplify Level 3
- Prioritize Level 1 and Level 4 (can skip Level 2/3 if needed)
- Encourage peer assistance

---

### Challenge 2: Hardware Issues | 硬件问题

**Problem**: Some sensors don't work, boards fail, wiring errors

**Solutions**:
- Always have backup boards (3+ extra)
- Keep backup sensors accessible
- Walk around to catch wiring errors early
- Teach systematic debugging (swap components)
- Allow students to choose different sensors if one fails

---

### Challenge 3: Git Confusion | Git困惑

**Problem**: First-time Git users struggle with workflow

**Solutions**:
- Use GitHub Desktop (more visual than command line)
- Provide step-by-step visual guide
- Do first commit as a class together
- Have TAs available for one-on-one Git help
- Accept late Git submissions (focus on hardware first)

---

### Challenge 4: Documentation Overwhelm | 文档压力

**Problem**: Writing README feels daunting to beginners

**Solutions**:
- Provide very detailed template
- Show example projects
- Allow Chinese first, translate later with AI
- Make minimum viable README acceptable
- Emphasize iteration (can improve later)

---

### Challenge 5: Publishing Anxiety | 发布焦虑

**Problem**: Students hesitant to publish "imperfect" work

**Solutions**:
- Emphasize learning process over perfection
- Show that maker community is supportive
- Instructor publishes first as example
- Frame it as portfolio building
- Offer bonus points for publishing

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Instructors | 教师专业提示

### Energy Management | 能量管理

**High-energy moments**:
- First successful Arduino upload (celebrate!)
- Level 4 project ideation (get excited!)
- First PR submission (recognize achievement!)

**Lower-energy moments**:
- Level 1 testing (can be repetitive)
- README writing (requires focus)

**Strategy**:
- Match your energy to the moment
- Take micro-breaks during student work time
- Stay hydrated and caffeinated
- Use music during work sessions (optional)

---

### Student Support Strategy | 学生支持策略

**Triage Priority**:
1. **Critical**: Student completely stuck, can't proceed
2. **High**: Technical issue preventing progress
3. **Medium**: Wants to improve beyond requirements
4. **Low**: Already working, has optional question

**Support Pattern**:
- Circulate constantly during work time
- Spot check every student at least once per level
- Identify struggling students early
- Pair strong students with struggling ones

---

### Documentation While Teaching | 教学中的记录

**What to Capture**:
- Photo each level's best examples
- Video 2-3 student demos
- Screenshot interesting code solutions
- Note common errors for improvement

**Why This Matters**:
- Use for next course improvement
- Share student work (with permission)
- Create case studies
- Show parents/administrators outcomes

---

### Flexibility Principles | 灵活性原则

**When to Adapt**:
- If 50%+ students struggling, pause and re-teach
- If way ahead of schedule, add depth challenges
- If way behind, skip Level 2 or 3
- If specific sensor causing universal problems, skip it

**What NOT to Compromise**:
- Level 1 (foundation building)
- Level 4 (final showcase)
- README documentation (core skill)
- Safety and proper handling

---
